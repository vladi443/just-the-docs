# Projects

---

Below is a list of the projects that are currently available for review. You can select a program from the list below or from the dropdown menu on the left. 

Every project's tab includes additional information about the program itself and its algorithm. A link is available at the bottom of each tab leading to the project's Github Repository. Some projects were inspired from already existing programs/games, such as the *Wordle Bot*. A link pointing towards the original program can be found on the bottom of each tab as well.

Big thanks to all the outside sources/inspirations for giving me ideas for projects and helping me in their execution.

Every project uploaded under the Ziggurat Systems Github Repository is licensed under GNU GPLv3, for which you can read more about in the projectsâ€™ README files.
