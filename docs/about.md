# About

---

I am a high school student with a huge interest in Computer Science and Math. Originally from Europe, I have taken several computer classes there, including programming fundamentals in C++, HTML and JS programming, and several school based math classes. In the US I am currently taking higher level math classes and IB Computer Science, and am looking into continuing my education in the Computer Science field. I also have experience in the Cyber Security field, including participating in *AFA CyberPatriot* competition, where my team and I have reached top 25 teams nationwide on the Semifinals round.
