# About

---

I am a high school student with a huge interest in Computer Science and Math. Originally from Europe, I have taken several computer classes there, including programming fundamentals in C++, HTML and JS programming, and several school based math classes. In the US I am currently taking higher level math classes and IB Computer Science, and am looking into continuing my education in the Computer Science field. I also have experience in the Cyber Security field, including participating in *AFA CyberPatriot* competition, where my team and I have reached top 25 teams nationwide on the Semifinals round.

I created Ziggurat Systems as a project primarly to learn how to use Github and edit / submit code on it. I decided the best way to learn it is by uploading my own projects on it, sharing them with others and learning from the community. Uploading my projects here allowed me to also easily share them with anyone interested in them, and allow them to use, share, or even edit some of the code. I want to use Ziggurat Systems as a site where I can share projects I am curently working on, and allow people who want to use or edit them for their needs. By doing that I am also aiming to learn more about Github Repositories, Pull Requests, and others.

If you want to support me, you can share this page with others who might be interested in the projects uploaded here. You can also buy me tea (**coming soon!**) by clicking the button below. Thank you for visiting Ziggurat Systems!
