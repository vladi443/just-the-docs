# Compile Instructions

This tab includes information on how to compile the projects and use them as executable programs. As not every project is using the same programming language, such as C++ or Java, separate instructions will be listed below on how to compile and run the code. 

As a student I am still learning and exploring these concepts so any suggestions are welcomed. If you would like to submit a feedback on the instructions, descriptions, or a suggestion on making compiling easier, you can do it by submitting a pull request under the Ziggurat Github Repository.
