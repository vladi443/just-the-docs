# Compile Instructions

This tab includes information on how to compile the projects and use them as executable programs. As not every project is using the same programming language, separate instructions will be listed below on how to compile and run each individual code. 

As a student I am still learning and exploring these concepts, so any feedbacks or recomendations are welcome and can be submitted under the Ziggurat Systems Github Repository.

## What is Compiling

Compiling code takes the *Source Code* (human readable) and transforms it into *machine code* (computer executable). Compiling code is done through a program called a *Compiler*, which takes the human written source code and converts it into a new language (*machine language*) which is understood by the computer. Compiling code is necessary as *machine language* code is extremely difficult for people to understand, and therefore the compiler acts as a "translator" from *high level language* to the *machine langauge* that computers understand.

Compilers have additional jobs such as ensuring your code is **TYPE** and **SYNTACTICALLY** correct. A compiler does not however check if your code is **LOGICALLY** correct.
