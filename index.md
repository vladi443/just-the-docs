Ziggurat Systems is a website I developed to share projects I am working on. You can discover the different programs I have or am currently developing and contribute, share, or use any of them for free. Projects’ list can be found in the *Projects* tab on the left, and additional information about me and this site can be found in the *About* tab also located on the left.

Projects’ tab includes list of programs that are currently in development. Each projects’ page includes information about the program, functioning process and usage instructions For additional information about a specific project, refer to the projects’ README file located in its Github Repository.

I aim to turn this site into a web portal that would link my projects and make them easy to share and use.
